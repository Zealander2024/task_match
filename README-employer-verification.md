# Employer ID Verification Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the employer ID verification feature, which allows employers to verify their identity using any valid Philippine ID.

## Components Created

1. **EmployerIDVerification.tsx**
   - Main component for employers to upload and verify their ID
   - Supports various Philippine ID types
   - Uses OCR to extract text from ID images/PDFs
   - Auto-verifies when possible or allows submission for admin review
   - Shows verification status and results

2. **Admin Verification Review**
   - Added `EmployerVerificationReview.tsx` component for admins to review employer ID verification requests
   - Integrated into the existing admin verification dashboard with a tabbed interface
   - Allows admins to approve or reject verification requests
   - Shows statistics and manages verification workflow

3. **Database Migration**
   - Added `employer_verification_requests` table to store verification requests
   - Set up row-level security policies to protect data
   - Created necessary indexes for performance

## Key Features

### For Employers
- Upload any valid Philippine ID (PhilID, Driver's License, Passport, etc.)
- Automatic ID validation with OCR text extraction

- Status indicators to show verification progress

### For Admins
- Dedicated interface to review employer ID verification requests

### Technical Implementation

## Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.employer_verification_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  employer_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  document_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')),
  submitted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  reviewed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  admin_notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
